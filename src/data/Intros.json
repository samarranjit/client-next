  "research_Desc": "Our vision is that advanced sensing, modeling, and big-data analytics will improve our understanding of hydrological cycle, climate and anthropogenic impacts on water resources, human societies, and infrastructures enabling a safer, more effective, and more resilient to future changes. Global warming is disrupting climate and weather patterns, leading to extreme events and unpredictable water availability, exacerbating water scarcity. To accurately detect, predict, and respond to such events, one must embrace a myriad of muti-sources geospatial data, ground measurements and multiple remote sensing data, and traditional and emerging data analysis techniques, physical modeling and machine learning..\n\n",

  "publication_desc": "Journal: Hydrology and Earth Systems Science\nIn this study, a series of UAS lidar/SfM snow depth maps were collected during a winter season in Durham, New Hampshire, USA with three objectives: (1) quantifying UAS lidar/SfM snow depth retrieval performance using multiple in-situ measurement techniques (magnaprobe and field cameras), (2) conducting a quantitative comparison of lidar and SfM snow depths (< 35 cm) throughout the winter, and (3) better understanding the spatial structure of snow depth and its relationship with terrain features."
