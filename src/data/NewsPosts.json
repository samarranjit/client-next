    "All members of the Cho Lab participated in an exciting two-day Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Training Workshop, held at Texas State University and led with expert guidance from Frontier Precision. The training provided hands-on experience with state-of-the-art UAV systems and advanced sensors for remote sensing and geospatial data collection.",
    "On the first day, Cho Lab members were introduced to UAV Assembly and Flight Operations.  Participants learned to assemble and pilot the Freefly Alta X, a powerful industrial drone designed for heavy-lift aerial imaging and mapping. Members also practiced using high-end sensors, including YellowScan Mapper+ LiDAR and Medusa Gamma Sensors.",
    "On the second day, the focus shifted to data processing and analysis. Members worked through the full pipeline of processing sensor data collected during flights over the Texas State Meadow Center. This included cleaning and aligning raw sensor data, generating digital elevation models, and visualizing terrain and radiation intensity.  While the process was initially challenging, participants showed great progress and confidence by the end of the session. To conclude the training, Cho Lab members conducted their first solo UAV missions, flying over the Meadow Center, collecting new data, and applying their newly acquired skills independently.\n\n",
    "In a meeting following the training, Dr. Eunsang Cho shared his enthusiasm and vision for the future, stating that he looks forward to more research projects that leverage the advanced capabilities of UAVs and sensors. The training has opened up new possibilities for innovative field-based research at Cho Lab.",
    "This training would not have been possible without the generous support of Frontier Precision and their instructor, Austin, whose clarity and hands-on guidance were instrumental in making the event a success.\n\nThank you to everyone who participated—we look forward to applying these skills to future fieldwork and research initiatives!"

    "This year, three members of the Cho Lab had the opportunity to attend the **[Eastern Snow Conference (ESC)](https://www.easternsnow.org/)**—an annual gathering of snow scientists and researchers from across North America. For our lab members, Eastern Snow Conference was more than just a scientific meeting; it was a space to connect, present, and grow within a passionate and collaborative research community. Here are their reflections:-",

    "\n ### Eunsaem Cho  : A Research Family in the Snow Science Community  \n\n![Alt text](https://res.cloudinary.com/cholab/image/upload/v1750904747/Screenshot_2025-06-25_212142_okfxu5.png)\n\n> ESC was excellent for building *Extremely Strong Connections* with snow researchers.\n\nEunsaem appreciated the intimate scale of the conference, which created a warm, family-like environment among attendees. This atmosphere allowed him to feel like a true part of the broader science research community.\n\nHis presentation was well-received and sparked several interesting questions. However, being scheduled last left limited time for deeper conversations and potential collaborations:\n> The conference felt too short—an extra day would have helped foster more meaningful discussions.\n\nOne standout memory was the early career happy hour, where casual networking over ice cream offered a fun break from formal sessions. He suggests future events could benefit from structured icebreakers to facilitate even stronger networking.\n\n**Advice for future attendees:**  \n“Study the shared slides and posters beforehand. And most importantly—ask questions and engage actively. That’s where the real value lies.\n #### Conference Slides: \n [![Conference Poster for ESC- Eunsaem Choji](https://res.cloudinary.com/cholab/image/upload/v1751004801/Slide1_deaksj.jpg)](/Files/Assets/ESC2025Slides/Eunsaem.pdf) \n",

    "### Farhaan Cooverji: Fostering Community and Collaboration\n\n![Alt text](https://res.cloudinary.com/cholab/image/upload/v1750785388/Farhaan1_xkofzd.jpg)\n\n> What stood out most was how committed the senior members were to fostering a collaborative snow science community.\n\nFarhaan described ESC as a uniquely welcoming space, especially for early-career researchers.\n\nHe presented a poster that drew valuable engagement. A key lesson? Always carry a notepad:\n> It’s handy for capturing feedback and connections in the moment.\n\nA particularly memorable interaction came right at the start—Dr. Jacobs (Dr. Cho’s advisor) warmly offered to connect him with key members of the snow research community. He also recalled the conference banquet, where he shared a table with student researchers working on diverse snow projects across North America:\n> It was wonderful to share insights and connect personally.\n\n**Advice for future attendees:**  \nConsider presenting a poster—it encourages more direct engagement. And refine your presentation as the event progresses, learning from your early interactions.\n #### Conference Poster: \n [![Conference Poster for ESC- Farhaan Cooverji](https://res.cloudinary.com/cholab/image/upload/v1751008581/Farhaan_ESC_poster_48x30_yxewo0.png)](/Files/Assets/ESC2025Slides/Farhaan_ESC_poster_(48x30).pdf)",

    "\n ### Jipeng Liu: Finding a Home Among Snow Scientists\n\n\n![Alt text](https://res.cloudinary.com/cholab/image/upload/v1750903469/20250604_200902268_iOS_rzdurf.jpg)\n\n> In other settings, my snow research often felt novel or niche. But at ESC, I felt completely at home.\n\nFor Jipeng, ESC was a transformative experience.\n\nPresenting his poster led to a memorable moment—meeting researchers who had helped collect the very datasets he was working with. This made his work feel even more impactful and connected to the broader scientific effort.\n\nAnother highlight was reconnecting with the UNH group and meeting Dr. Jacobs:\n> Meeting my advisor’s advisor felt surreal. She was incredibly kind—and I could see the wisdom in her eyes. I also enjoyed connecting with other members of the UNH team, especially Adam and Jeremy, whom I hadn't seen in a long time.\n\n**Advice for future attendees:**  \nBe confident. Talk to people. Conferences like ESC offer a rare and rewarding chance to exchange ideas and build lasting academic relationships.\n #### Conference Poster: \n [![Conference Poster for ESC- Jipeng](https://res.cloudinary.com/cholab/image/upload/v1751010148/1_ESC_Jipeng_gsnj8g.png)](/Files/Assets/ESC2025Slides/1_ESC_Jipeng.pdf)",

    "\n ### Looking Ahead\n\nFrom meaningful scientific exchanges to warm personal connections, the Eastern Snow Conference left a lasting impression on the Cho Lab attendees. As our research continues to grow, so too does our place in the broader snow science community. We look forward to more conferences, more conversations—and more snow."
