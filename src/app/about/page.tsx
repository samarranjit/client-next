                We are building a dynamic team of undergraduate and graduate
                students and postdocs who share our passion to better understand
                hydrology and water resources in a changing climate for a
                sustainable environment. To achieve this, we use field
                observations from station data and field campaign, multiple
                remote sensing techniques, land surface hydrologic models, and
                climate models along with big-data and machine learning (ML)
                techniques.
